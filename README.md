## Welcome to the Mario Game! Follow these instructions to play:

Collect as many coins as possible to reach a maximum score of **15**. You have three levels to explore, and there's no time limit.

**Controls:**
- Use the **left arrow key** to move left.
- Use the **right arrow key** to move right.
- Press the **spacebar** to make Mario jump.

**Gameplay:**
1. **Collecting Coins:** To score points, you must collect coins. You can do this by touching them.

2. **Question Mark Blocks:** Approach question mark blocks from below and press the **spacebar** to hit them. These blocks may contain either a coin or a mushroom.

3. **Mushrooms:** If you find a mushroom, touch it to turn into Super Mario. Super Mario can jump higher. This power-up only lasts for a limited time, so make the most of it.

4. **Defeating Enemies:** You can defeat enemies by jumping on top of them. However, you won't earn points for this. Avoid touching enemies in any other way, or the game will end.

5. **Level Transition:** To enter the next level, simply press **down** when you are on top of a green pipe. Each level offers new challenges and opportunities to collect coins.

6. **Game Over:** If you die during the game, you'll need to start collecting scores from zero again. Be careful!

7. **Restart:** If you want to start over or refresh the game, simply **refresh the page** in your web browser.

**Winning the Game:**
Your goal is to reach a maximum score of 15 by collecting coins across the three levels. There's no time limit, so take your time.

Enjoy the game and see if you can reach the maximum score and complete all three levels. Good luck!
